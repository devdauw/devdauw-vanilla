          Welcome on my website, this is using Vanilla JavaScript & CSS for everything. Why you may ask? React and consort are just unnecessary overhead on a private project. In my day to day, like everybody I'm using React, Express & all that jam and, as I continue to develop my software engineer skills, I feel like the whole opacity of the frameworks is holding me back.

          That's why I decided to work from scracth on this `website`. So it's using NodeJS for serving pages instead of relying on Express/Deno/Bun or anything else. The only package imported from NPM are a bundler (rollup) so that I can use libraries for composing my website. I chose to use Material UI that just released version 3 recently.
