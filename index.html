        <p>
          Welcome to my website, I'm Julien, a <span id="currentAge"></span> years old tinkerer from Belgium 🇧🇪. It's using TypeScript & basic CSS for everything. In my day to day work, like most, I'm using React, Express & all that jazz and, as I continue to develop my software engineer skills, I feel like the whole opacity of the frameworks is holding me back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, it may be faster to plug & play whole frameworks and libraries, make me more employable by checking ✔️ another thing to put on <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my resume</a>, but you don't get to learn and practice the basics. I never ran a barebone server using only Node before this project. I never worked with Web Components either, or modern CSS and since I don't have any shareholder to respond to, let's experiment!
        </p>
        <h2>The stack 🔥</h2>
        <p>
          This website is nearly built <i>from scratch</i>. That's not to say it isn't using mordern techniques and tooling. 
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Components!</a> With their Shadow DOM 🥷 allowing for easier styling without relying on Tailwind/Bootstrap/CSSFrameworkOfTheCurrentYear. And still composing the interface <i>à la</i> React.</li>
            <li>NodeJS for routing instead of relying on Express/Deno/Bun and their abstractions! [It may change in the future. Bun seems interesting, maybe a part of this website will be served by it 🤷‍♂️]</li>
            <li>Rollup as bundler. I'm using <a href="https://m3.material.io/develop/web">Material UI web</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WICG/import-maps">import maps aren't yet first class citizens</a>, it had to come! Plus reducing bundle size is always welcome and I never did bundler configuration before.</li>
            <li>Served by Render as a Web Service. It will spin down if it hasn't been browsed in a while and you may wait when loading the website... What we do for nature 🌳!</li>
            <li>For the Material UI part: I've limited ressources, mainly limited time because I don't lack imagination 🌈! Relying on proven open-source packages isn't a philosophical failure: I know accessibility isn't always the best for people with disabilities thus relying on tested and community maintained packages for a smoother experience is only logical!</li>
